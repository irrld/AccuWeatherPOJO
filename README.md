# BasicAccuWeatherAPI

### Usage
```java
Weather weather = WeatherAPI.getWeather("key","lang","locationID");  
```
If you write `weather.` your ide should show the methods that you can use.

I don't setup a public repository for this project, you can compile it yourself or use the sources directly in your project.
